This script converts the CSV files exported from Mint into a series of CSV files that can be read in by HomeBank in order
to seed a HomeBank with historical data from Mint. Note when exporting data from Mint that it only exports 10,000 entries
at a time! If you have an old enough account you'll have far more than this.

This script was necessary because Mint has been shut down and they tried to move everybody to Credit Karma. That site
doesn't do budgeting.
